A poem is a literary composition, written by a poet, using this principle.
Poetry has a long and varied history, evolving differentially across the globe.
It dates back at least to prehistoric times with hunting poetry in Africa and to panegyric and elegiac court poetry of the empires of the Nile, Niger, and Volta River valleys.
Some of the earliest written poetry in Africa occurs among the Pyramid Texts written during the 25th century BCE.
The earliest surviving Western Asian epic poetry, the Epic of Gilgamesh, was written in Sumerian.
